"""
Ensuring Safe Access with Locks.

Context
-------
This lesson demonstrates how to use `asyncio.Lock` to safely protect shared state
accessed by multiple coroutines. When multiple tasks try to read or write shared data
concurrently, race conditions can occur. By using a Lock, you can guarantee that only
one coroutine modifies the shared resource at a time, preserving data integrity.

Summary
-------
- Introduce `asyncio.Lock` to control concurrent access to a shared resource.
- Show that multiple tasks incrementing a shared counter without a lock can cause
  race conditions.
- Demonstrate how locking ensures consistent final values by serializing access.
- Reference `src/006_task_groups.py` for supervising these workers with
  structured concurrency.

Official Documentation:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Lock

Doctest Notes:
- The final result should be deterministic when using a lock.
- We rely on minimal sleeps and await calls to simulate concurrent work.
