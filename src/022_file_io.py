Asynchronous File I/O Operations.

Context
-------
This lesson demonstrates asynchronous file I/O patterns in Python. While Python's
built-in file operations are synchronous and can block the event loop, we'll explore
techniques to handle file I/O asynchronously, including using thread executors for
file operations and implementing streaming patterns for large files.

Prerequisites: Understanding of async/await, asyncio.run(), and basic file operations.
This lesson builds on the concurrency concepts from lessons 1-5 and the I/O patterns
introduced in lesson 12 (streams).

Summary
-------
- Learn to perform file operations without blocking the event loop.
- Use `asyncio.to_thread()` for simple file operations.
- Implement streaming file reading for large files.
- Handle multiple file operations concurrently.
- Understand when and why to use async file I/O.

Official Documentation:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.to_thread
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor

Doctest Notes:
- We use temporary files to ensure consistent, reproducible tests.
- File operations are deterministic, making doctests straightforward.

async def read_file_async(filepath: Path) -> str:

    Read a file asynchronously using asyncio.to_thread().

    This prevents blocking the event loop during file I/O operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : Path
        Path to the file to read.

    Returns
    -------
    str
